# ImpactHook

**Asset-class specific liquidity for real-world impact.**

ImpactHook is a Uniswap v4 hook that creates a new category of liquidity pool where swap fees are programmatically routed to verified impact projects. Pools are differentiated not just by token pair or fee tier, but by the real-world outcome they fund - clean water, climate research, school meals, open-source infrastructure.

This is asset-class specific liquidity: pools with distinct characteristics shaped by milestone-gated funding, cross-chain verification, and performance-based fee progression. Traders self-select into impact-aligned venues. LPs provide liquidity knowing their pools serve a purpose beyond yield. The result is a new DeFi primitive that turns trading volume into measurable social impact.

**LPs earn full yield. Traders choose their impact. Projects get funded when milestones are proven on-chain.**

## Why This Matters

$2.5 trillion in daily crypto trading volume generates zero social impact. Meanwhile, traditional impact funding is opaque and slow - grant recipients wait months for disbursement, donors can't verify outcomes, and intermediaries take cuts.

ImpactHook connects these two worlds:
- **Continuous funding**: Every swap generates fees, not once-a-year grants
- **Milestone-gated**: No results, no funding. Verification happens on-chain before fees release
- **Dual-channel**: DeFi swap fees and institutional escrow share the same source of truth
- **Cross-chain**: Milestones can be verified from any supported chain via Reactive Network
- **Permissionless**: Anyone can create an impact pool for any cause. No gatekeepers

## How It Works

```
Swap happens → afterSwap() takes fee based on current milestone tier
                    ↓
Fee accumulates in contract per pool per currency
                    ↓
Verifier confirms milestone → fee tier adjusts for future swaps
                    ↓
Project recipient withdraws accumulated fees
```

Each pool has a `Project` config with:
- **Recipient**: address that receives accumulated fees
- **Verifier**: address authorized to verify milestones (EOA, multisig, or Reactive Network RSC)
- **Milestones**: ordered list with descriptions and fee tiers (in bps)

### Contracts

| Contract | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `ImpactHook.sol` | Core Uniswap v4 hook - fee routing, milestone tracking, withdrawal, cross-chain callback handler |
| `MilestoneArbiter.sol` | Alkahest IArbiter - gates escrow release on milestone verification |
| `MilestoneReactor.sol` | Reactive Network RSC - subscribes to origin chain events, emits cross-chain callbacks |
| `MilestoneOracle.sol` | Origin chain event emitter - milestone submissions trigger the cross-chain flow |

### Two Funding Channels, One Source of Truth

1. **Swap fees** (DeFi-native): The hook charges a small fee on swap output via `afterSwapReturnDelta`. Continuous funding from trading activity.

2. **Grant escrow** (institutional): Integration with [Alkahest](https://github.com/arkhai-io/alkahest) (Zellic-audited) escrow. `MilestoneArbiter` reads milestone state from the hook to gate escrow release.

Both channels are gated by the same on-chain milestone state.

### Cross-Chain Milestone Verification

```
Origin Chain              Reactive Network           Destination Chain
(any supported)           (ReactVM)                  (Unichain)

MilestoneOracle    ──→    MilestoneReactor    ──→    ImpactHook
  emits event              subscribes &               verifyMilestoneReactive()
  MilestoneSubmitted       emits Callback             updates milestone state
```

The hook supports [Reactive Network](https://reactive.network) callbacks for cross-chain milestone verification. `MilestoneReactor` (deployed on Reactive Network) subscribes to `MilestoneSubmitted` events from `MilestoneOracle` on any origin chain and triggers `verifyMilestoneReactive()` on the hook via the chain's Callback Proxy.

Authorization: the Reactive Network overwrites the first callback argument with the ReactVM ID. The hook checks `msg.sender == callbackProxy` and `rvmId == project.verifier`.

## Partner Integrations

| Partner | Integration | Location |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Uniswap Foundation** | Novel v4 hook creating asset-class specific liquidity via milestone-gated fee routing (`afterSwapReturnDelta`) | `src/ImpactHook.sol` |
| **Unichain** | Deployed on Unichain Sepolia (OP Stack L2). EAS attestations for milestone verification. | All contracts |
| **Reactive Network** | Cross-chain milestone verification: `MilestoneOracle` → `MilestoneReactor` RSC → `verifyMilestoneReactive()` | `src/MilestoneOracle.sol`, `src/MilestoneReactor.sol`, `src/ImpactHook.sol` |
| **Arkhai (Alkahest)** | Milestone-gated escrow via `IArbiter` integration | `src/MilestoneArbiter.sol` |

## Fee Model

The hook charges a fee **on top of** the standard LP fee, taken from the swapper's output:

- LP yield is **unaffected** - no reason not to LP in impact pools
- Fee rate is determined by the current verified milestone's `projectFeeBps`
- Maximum fee capped at 500 bps (5%)
- Before any milestones are verified, the fee is 0
- Permissionless project registration - anyone can create an impact pool

Example progression:
| Milestone | Status | Fee |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| 0: "Project registered" | Verified | 0% |
| 1: "Phase 1 complete" | Verified | 2% |
| 2: "Phase 2 complete" | Not yet | - |
| 3: "Self-sustaining" | Not yet | - |

## Usage

### Build

```shell
forge build
```

### Test

```shell
forge test
```

39 tests covering: project registration, swap fee accumulation (both directions), milestone verification, fee progression, withdrawal, access control, Reactive Network callbacks, MilestoneOracle, MilestoneReactor, MilestoneArbiter (Alkahest), end-to-end cross-chain flow, and fuzz testing.

### Deploy (Unichain Sepolia)

```shell
forge script script/DeployHook.s.sol:DeployHookScript \
  --rpc-url https://sepolia.unichain.org \
  --private-key <key> \
  --broadcast
```

The deployment script mines a CREATE2 salt to produce a hook address with the correct permission flags (`beforeInitialize`, `afterSwap`, `afterSwapReturnDelta`).
